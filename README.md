Code and solutions to Write yourself a Scheme in 48 hours (ongoing)

This repository contains the code for Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours along with the solutions to the exercises.

In my solutions, I've opted to use more monadic code than the typical do blocks. I decided to do this for a few reasons:

1) It makes me think about the problems in a completely new way (since do blocks are still reminiscent of an imperative style).

2) It helps me get a more intuitive understanding of monads and the bind notation.
